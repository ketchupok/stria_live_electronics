#todo add PD patch for max 8 faders here


# debugging:
comparing:
csound_stria_render.aif; (Csound)
-> taking into account that Dustins mappings were also missing Events, eg. 64
20231221_102025_Rtext_8Ch.wav; (my reduced PD Patch, my mappings)
20231221_104827_Rtexts_16Ch.wav; (Dustins, PD Patch but with my mappings)

 
- overall
	- amplitudes of PD version do not match Csound, less dynamic range overall

	- in both versions; at some point events are missing; I suspect a polyphony problem, but can also be an assignemnt of metafaders.
	


in 8Ch version:
	- glitches appear, but it might be that I reduced this one delay too much, but cant find where it was; it was 500 I made it 50 somewhere	-> yes this was in poly
	- and poly was too small, we had voice stealing all the time, hwoever, releases seem wrong as it goes up to more than 60 voices, which should not happen





16ch version: 
	- we never use 16 -> make it 8
	- the top down is opposite from score, flip it
	- what are all these "Faderlookup" files, they seem unused

Dustin 16Ch, Dustin Mapping (v3 Dezember, with first CC Checker) hangs
	- hangs with event 165; so this proofs that these mappings are not playable with this PD patch.
	- creates glitches at 7:00 + 8:29 (508 sec)
